\description{
\code{ss.power.spa} returns the necessary per-group sample size
  to achieve a desired level of statistical power for a planned study testing
  an omnibus effect using a two-factor split-plot (mixed) ANOVA, based on
  information obtained from a previous study. The effect from the previous
  study can be corrected for publication bias and/or uncertainty to provide a
  sample size that will achieve more accurate statistical power for a planned
  study, when compared to approaches that use a sample effect size at face
  value or rely on sample size only.
}
\details{
Researchers often use the sample effect size from a prior study as
  an estimate of the likely size of an expected future effect in sample size
  planning. However, sample effect size estimates should not usually be used
  at face value to plan sample size, due to both publication bias and
  uncertainty.

The approach implemented in \code{ss.power.spa} uses the observed
\eqn{t}-value and sample size from a previous study to correct the
noncentrality parameter associated with the effect of interest for
publication bias and/or uncertainty. This new estimated noncentrality
parameter is then used to calculate the necessary per-group sample size to
achieve the desired level of power in the planned study.

  The approach uses the following likelihood function: \deqn{
  f_{L}[f_{S};\nu_{1},\nu_{2},\omega]=\frac{f_{F}[f_{S}|\nu_{1},\nu_{2},
  \omega]}{1-F_{F}[f_{crit}(1-\alpha_{S})|\nu_{1},\nu_{2},\omega]} } to
  select an appropriate estimated noncentrality parameter. The formula
  represents the density of a truncated noncentral \eqn{F}-distribution,
  where \eqn{f_{F}} is the probability density function of the noncentral
  \eqn{F}-distribution from the original study, \eqn{f_{S}} is the observed
  \eqn{F}-value for the original study, \eqn{F_{F}} is the cumulative
  distribution function indicating the probability that a noncentral
  \eqn{F}-distribution exceeds the critical value, \eqn{f_{crit}} is the
  critical \eqn{F}-value for \eqn{\alpha_{s}}, the specified
  \eqn{\alpha}-level of the original study, \eqn{\nu_{1}} and \eqn{\nu_{2}}
  are the degrees of freedom of the previous study, and \eqn{\omega} is the
  noncentrality parameter being estimated for sample size planning. The
  numerator is the likelihood of obtaining the observed previous study
  \eqn{F}-value given the noncentrality parameter. The denominator can be
  thought of as the power of the test given the specified noncentrality
  parameter.

Assurance is the proportion of times that power will be at or above the
desired level, if the experiment were to be reproduced many times. For
example, assurance = .5 means that power will be above the desired level half
of the time, but below the desired level the other half of the time.
Selecting assurance = .5 (selecting the noncentrality parameter at the 50th
percentile of the likelihood distribution) results in a median-unbiased
estimate of the population noncentrality parameter and corrects for
publication bias only. In order to correct for uncertainty, assurance > .5
can be selected, which corresponds to selecting the noncentrality parameter
associated with the (1 - assurance) quantile of the likelihood distribution.

If the previous study of interest is unpublished (e.g., a pilot study),
\code{alpha.prior} can be set to 1 to indicate no publication bias.
Alternative \eqn{\alpha}-levels can also be accommodated to represent
differing amounts of publication bias. For example, setting
\code{alpha.prior}=.20 would reflect less severe publication bias than the
default of .05. In essence, setting \code{alpha.prior} at .20 assumes that
studies with \eqn{p}-values less than .20 are published, whereas those with
alrger \eqn{p}-values are not.

In some cases, the corrected noncentrality parameter for a given level of
assurance will be estimated to be zero. This is an indication that the
previous study's effect cannot be accurately estimated due to high levels of
uncertainty and bias. When this happens, subsequent sample size planning is
not possible with the chosen specifications. Two alternatives are
recommended. First, users can select a lower value of assurance (e.g. .5
instead of .8). Second, users can reduce the influence of publciation bias by
setting \code{alpha.prior} at a value greater than .05. It is possible to
correct for uncertainty only by setting \code{alpha.prior}=1 and choosing the
desired level of assurance.

\code{ss.power.spa} assumes that the planned study will have equal n. Unequal
n in the previous study is handled in the following way for split plot
designs. If the user enters an N not divisible by the number of
between-subjects cells, the function calculates n by dividing N by the number
of between-subjects cells and both rounding up and rounding down the result.
The suggested sample size for the planned study is calculated using both of
these values of n, and the function returns the larger of these two
suggestions, to be conservative.
